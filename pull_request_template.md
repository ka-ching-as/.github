**Explanation**
Add a clear and concise explanation of what the PR is about. Imagine you are writing to someone who has never seen the project, and want to quickly get them up to speed.

(Writing tips)

If it's:
- A new feature: explain what the feature does.
- An addition to an existing feature: explain how the feature behaved previously, and how this changes the feature.
- A bug fix: explain what the bug was and how the new correct behavior is now.

For example: “This PR adds a Microsoft signup method to our login screen. Previously we had only Apple sign up and Google sign up.”

**Source**
What is the source of the PR? Is it something external, for example a customer request, or something internal, for example, driven by the team itself.

**Screenshots/videos**
Add a screenshot or video (or even a combination of both) to further improve the PR, especially if it’s a UI/UX change.
